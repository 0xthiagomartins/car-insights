# Sprint 2: Data Collection Goals

## Primary Objectives
1. Implement robust data collection from primary sources
2. Develop data cleaning and normalization pipeline
3. Create data validation framework
4. Establish initial data storage and retrieval system

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Data collection script successfully retrieves data from target sources
- [ ] Data cleaning pipeline handles common data issues
- [ ] Validation framework identifies and flags problematic data
- [ ] Data storage system efficiently stores and retrieves collected data
- [ ] Initial dataset of at least 1000 vehicle listings collected

## Key Deliverables
- Functional data collection scripts
- Data cleaning and normalization pipeline
- Data validation framework
- Initial dataset in storage
- Data collection documentation

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Website structure changes breaking scraping
  - **Mitigation**: Implement robust error handling and monitoring
- **Risk**: Rate limiting or IP blocking from data sources
  - **Mitigation**: Implement proper delays and rotation of user agents
- **Risk**: Data quality issues
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive validation and cleaning procedures
- **Risk**: Performance issues with large datasets
  - **Mitigation**: Optimize database queries and implement pagination

## Sprint Metrics
- Data collection success rate: >95%
- Data cleaning accuracy: >90%
- Data validation coverage: 100%
- Storage system response time: <500ms
- Dataset size: >1000 listings
