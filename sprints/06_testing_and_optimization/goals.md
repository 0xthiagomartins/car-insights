# Sprint 6: Testing and Optimization Goals

## Primary Objectives
1. Conduct comprehensive testing of all system components
2. Optimize performance across the application
3. Implement error handling and logging
4. Conduct user testing and gather feedback
5. Prepare for final deployment

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All components tested with >80% code coverage
- [ ] Performance bottlenecks identified and addressed
- [ ] Error handling implemented for all critical paths

- Performance optimization report
- Error handling documentation
- User testing feedback report
- Updated system documentation
- Deployment checklist

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Critical bugs discovered late in testing
  - **Mitigation**: Prioritize critical path testing early
- **Risk**: Performance issues difficult to resolve
  - **Mitigation**: Implement monitoring and profiling tools
- **Risk**: User feedback requires major changes
  - **Mitigation**: Conduct early user testing and iterative feedback
- **Risk**: Deployment environment differences
  - **Mitigation**: Test in environment similar to production

## Sprint Metrics
- Code coverage: >80%
- Performance improvement: >20%
