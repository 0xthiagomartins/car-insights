# Sprint Management

This directory contains the sprint documentation for the Car Price Insights project. Each sprint is organized in its own directory with a consistent structure.

## Sprint Structure

Each sprint directory should contain:

1. `goals.md` - Sprint objectives and success criteria
2. `tasks.md` - Detailed task breakdown and tracking

### Sprint Status Indicators

Tasks and sprints can have the following status:

- ðŸ”´ **Not Started** - Task hasn't been initiated
- ðŸŸ¡ **In Progress** - Task is currently being worked on
- ðŸŸ¢ **Completed** - Task has been finished
- âš« **Blocked** - Task is blocked by dependencies
- ðŸ”µ **In Review** - Task is completed and under review

## Sprint Directory Structure
